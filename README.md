# GantSign IntelliJ IDEA Inspection Profile

The inspections built into IntelliJ IDEA are a powerful tool to educate
developers and improve code quality; however, the default configuration profile
is quite conservative, appropriate for existing codebases as well as new code.
If you're working on a new codebase a stricter inspection profile will encourage
more best practice and further improve code quality.

The GantSign IntelliJ IDEA Inspection Profile (for Java and Kotlin) is much
stricter than the default inspection profile, many inspections are upgraded from
warnings to errors and additional inspections are enabled. This inspection
profile is ideal for new projects and particularly beneficial to less
experienced developers.

By catching basic code quality issues in the IDE this reduces the need to
address such issues in code review.
